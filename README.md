# Raytracer #

## Overview ##

The basis for this project is the skeleton raytracer from [Ray tracing from the Ground Up](http://www.raytracegroundup.com/) book's website. I will expand it as I deepen my understanding of the techniques explained in the book.

The project is in Visual Studio 2013 format and uses wxWidgets for the user interface.
